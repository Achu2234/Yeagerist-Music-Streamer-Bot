### Concepts

#### Issues as incidents

When the GitHub Actions workflow detects that one of your URLs is down, it automatically opens a GitHub issue ([example issue #15](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime/issues/15)). You can add incident reports to this issue by adding comments. When your site comes back up, the issue will be closed automatically as well.
